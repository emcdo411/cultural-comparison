## Introduction
This repository is a heartfelt exploration of cultural differences between Sweden and the United States, inspired by conversations with my girlfriend, Maria. It’s my way of showing that I’m not just listening — I’m actively seeking to understand the deeper values that shape how people express support and care.

## Insights from a Relationship Coach
> “Visible encouragement isn’t the only form of support — in some cultures, deep loyalty is shown quietly, in actions rather than words. Understanding this difference can prevent misinterpretation and keep the relationship secure.”

This perspective reframes perceived silence not as disinterest, but as a different love language.

## Conclusion
This project is more than just a diagram — it’s my way of building a bridge between two cultures, and showing Maria that I’m committed to understanding not just *her*, but the world she lives in.
